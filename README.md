# tex2bib
Fetches bibtex citations from multiple tex files. We are using the very good [arix2bib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathangrigg/arxiv2bib) by Nathan Grigg shamelessly.

Very basic usage:

    $ tex2bib file1 file2 ...

Wildcards can be used.

Install
-------

At the moment, the only way to use tex2bib is as a standalone executable.
Just link it to somewhere in your path (like ``/usr/local/bin``).
